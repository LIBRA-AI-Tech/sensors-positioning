# Bluetooth Indoor Positioning with DNNs
ðŸ”­ This repository contains 5 different machine learning approaches that predict a tag's location based on received signals from 4 different anchor points.

ðŸ”— The dataset on which the machine learning models were trained and evaluated can be found here:
https://zenodo.org/record/6303184

ðŸ”¬ functions.py contains functions that all of the models use and should be in the same directory with the notebooks

ðŸ”¬ .ipynb files contain the 5 different machine learning methods
